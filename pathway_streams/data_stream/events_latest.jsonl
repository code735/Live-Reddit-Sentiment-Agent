In 2018, these shares have been dematriliased and the shares have been tied to the demat account with coimbatore capital. Today, I had confirmed with Coimbatore Capital that the account with coimbatore capital is a Demat account ONLY and not a Demat+Trading account. So my mom cannot sell any shares unless she has a trading account. We want to sell because we want to purchase a property under section 54F.\n\nI had just opened a Zerodha account for my mom under her own name and we plan to transfer the shares to this Zerodha account so that we can sell the shares. To transfer the shares from Coimbatore Capital (Demat only account) to Zerodha account (Demat + trading account) I need to complete a couple of forms which I will do this week. But before we actually transfer, I just want to confirm the following.\n\n1. If I transfer the shares on for eg, Jan 06th 2026 and sell them from the Zerodha account on Jan 07th 2026, will my mom be taxed as SCTG because the holding period was only 1 day or will it be taxed as LTCG because it was basically self transfer ? \n\n2. If it is LTCG, what proof should I provide to my auditor during tax filing under section 54F that these shares have been held for more than 20 years. Where should i get the actual proof of when the shares were acquired. Some of the shares for eg, Jindal steel are now traded as JSW steel and they have had several splits and bonus shares allocated so it’s very confusing on how the actual date on acquisation will be calculated and how I’ll be taxed. \n\nThanks for your replies!", "comments": [{"user_name": "AutoModerator", "text": "\nGeneral Guidelines - Buy/Sell, one-liner and Portfolio review posts will be removed.\n\nPlease refer to the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/wiki/index/) where most common questions have already been answered.

In 2018, these shares have been dematriliased and the shares have been tied to the demat account with coimbatore capital. Today, I had confirmed with Coimbatore Capital that the account with coimbatore capital is a Demat account ONLY and not a Demat+Trading account. So my mom cannot sell any shares unless she has a trading account. We want to sell because we want to purchase a property under section 54F.\n\nI had just opened a Zerodha account for my mom under her own name and we plan to transfer the shares to this Zerodha account so that we can sell the shares. To transfer the shares from Coimbatore Capital (Demat only account) to Zerodha account (Demat + trading account) I need to complete a couple of forms which I will do this week. But before we actually transfer, I just want to confirm the following.\n\n1. If I transfer the shares on for eg, Jan 06th 2026 and sell them from the Zerodha account on Jan 07th 2026, will my mom be taxed as SCTG because the holding period was only 1 day or will it be taxed as LTCG because it was basically self transfer ? \n\n2. If it is LTCG, what proof should I provide to my auditor during tax filing under section 54F that these shares have been held for more than 20 years. Where should i get the actual proof of when the shares were acquired. Some of the shares for eg, Jindal steel are now traded as JSW steel and they have had several splits and bonus shares allocated so it’s very confusing on how the actual date on acquisation will be calculated and how I’ll be taxed. \n\nThanks for your replies!", "comments": [{"user_name": "AutoModerator", "text": "\nGeneral Guidelines - Buy/Sell, one-liner and Portfolio review posts will be removed.\n\nPlease refer to the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/wiki/index/) where most common questions have already been answered.
